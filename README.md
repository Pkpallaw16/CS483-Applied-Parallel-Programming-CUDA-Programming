## üöÄ Project Milestones

### üß© Milestone 1: Naive Convolution
- Implemented 2D convolution using a simple CUDA kernel.
- Used only global memory and measured baseline runtime.

### üîÅ Milestone 2: Matrix Unrolling + GEMM
- Transformed convolution into matrix multiplication via input unrolling.
- Verified correctness and profiled kernel performance.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Milestone 3: Optimized GPU Convolution
- Applied advanced CUDA optimizations:
  - `Streams`
  - `Shared Memory` tiling / `Tensor Cores`
  - `Kernel Fusion`
- Achieved < 80ms batch inference time for 10,000 images.
- Experimented with additional techniques: `cuBLAS`, `__restrict__`, `loop unrolling`.
